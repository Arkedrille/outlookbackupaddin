Version 1.2
- Fixed problem when showing many psd-files within configuration dialog
- Backup program shows files, which are currently copied (refresh-issue in older version)
- Added new console parameter /backupnow
- Timestamp of last backup is only set when at least one file could be copied successfully 

Version 1.1
- Added an msi setup-project for Install Shield limited edition
- BackupExecutor has now two optional parameters
  /register will register the outlook plugin in the registry and copy the contents of \32 or \64 to the installation folder
  /unregister will delete the registry key and disable the outlook plugin
  The first parameter is used during installation to activate the plugin.
  It will check the "bitness" of the installed outlook, check the OS and create the necessary registry settings for the plugin.
  This is unfortunately not possible with Install Shield limited edition.

Version 1.0

- Tested with Win8 Pro, Office 2013 64 Bit

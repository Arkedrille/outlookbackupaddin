Version 1.1
- Added an msi setup-project for Install Shield limited edition
- BackupExecutor has now two optional parameters
  /register will register the outlook plugin in the registry and copy the contents of \32 or \64 to the installation folder
  /unregister will delete the registry key and disable the outlook plugin
  The first parameter is used during installation to activate the plugin.
  It will check the "bitness" of the installed outlook, check the OS and create the necessary registry settings for the plugin.
  This is unfortunately not possible with Install Shield limited edition.

Version 1.0
- First release. Works with office 2013 32 and 64 Bit
- Tested with Win8 Pro, Office 2013 64 Bit
